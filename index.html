            <p class="job-description">
              After graduating high school, I worked as a landscaper for six
              years, gaining extensive experience in various roles. As a lawn
              specialist, I maintained and enhanced the health and appearance of
              lawns. I also took on labor-intensive tasks and worked as a mason,
              handling everything from planting to hardscaping. My diverse skill
              set allowed me to contribute effectively to all aspects of
              landscaping projects.

            <p class="job-description">
              As an electrical engineer with two years of experience wiring
              buses, I specialized in installing and maintaining electrical
              systems to ensure optimal performance and safety. My role involved
              interpreting and following detailed schematics to accurately wire
              various components. I collaborated closely with other engineers
              and technicians to troubleshoot and resolve any electrical issues.
              Additionally, my ability to read and understand complex schematics
              allowed me to efficiently execute wiring tasks and contribute to
              the overall reliability of the bus systems.

            <h4 class="job-title">Union Heat and Insulation (Local 75):</h4>
            <p class="job-description">
              For five years, I worked in union heat and insulation, ensuring
              that hospitals and power plants were properly insulated. This role
              involved applying my skills to maintain energy efficiency and
              safety standards in critical facilities. During this time, I also
              pursued and earned my Associate's Degree in Applied Science. My
              experience in this field has equipped me with a strong foundation
              in both practical and theoretical aspects of insulation and energy
              management.

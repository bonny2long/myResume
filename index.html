          Landscaper (New Creation Landscaping):
          <p>
            After graduating high school, I worked as a landscaper for six
            years, gaining extensive experience in various roles. As a lawn
            specialist, I maintained and enhanced the health and appearance of
            lawns. I also took on labor-intensive tasks and worked as a mason,
            handling everything from planting to hardscaping. My diverse skill
            set allowed me to contribute effectively to all aspects of
            landscaping projects.

          Electrical Engineer (Alexander Dennis):
          <p>
            As an electrical engineer with two years of experience wiring buses,
            I specialized in installing and maintaining electrical systems to
            ensure optimal performance and safety. My role involved interpreting
            and following detailed schematics to accurately wire various
            components. I collaborated closely with other engineers and
            technicians to troubleshoot and resolve any electrical issues.
            Additionally, my ability to read and understand complex schematics
            allowed me to efficiently execute wiring tasks and contribute to the
            overall reliability of the bus systems.

          Union Heat and Insulation(Local 75):
          <p>
            For five years, I worked in union heat and insulation, ensuring that
            hospitals and power plants were properly insulated. This role
            involved applying my skills to maintain energy efficiency and safety
            standards in critical facilities. During this time, I also pursued
            and earned my Bachelor's degree in Applied Science. My experience in
            this field has equipped me with a strong foundation in both
            practical and theoretical aspects of insulation and energy
            management.
